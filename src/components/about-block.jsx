            <p>I am a full stack software engineer excited to learn and grow in a challenging, ever-changing field. I work to engineer simple, effective, & powerful solutions for users on and around the Web. I have recently been working on complex problems using Design Thinking and Human Cantered Design. I was drawn to software engineering because I wanted to deepen my technical expertise, and make a career change into a highly demanded and highly demanding field, with greater multi-dimensional  opportunities for growth.</p>
